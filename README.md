Hi,

I'm Sambodh, a rising sophomore at Vanderbilt University majoring in Biology. I'm primarily interested in the multi-omics approach to traumatic injury, but dabble in other computational problems including statistical mechanics and predictive modeling. I also run data analytics for Vanderbilt Soccer.
